# 1g1-bot

# What is this ?

<p>It's a bot that I made during my free time to exploit NodeJS (discord.js library), to make a bot that helps my University Students in our Discord Server. It has a lot of functionallities that helps students in their lessons, or just to pass time on Discord.</p>

# What did I learned from this project ?

<p>I learned about how to make a Discord Bot by using JavaScript, I already used Python in the past, but with javascript it's a lot easier I think so.</p>
<p>I also learned how to extract and make functions in/from other files.</p>
